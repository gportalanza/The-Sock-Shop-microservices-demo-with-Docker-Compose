# Microservices-demo-with-Docker-Compose

This is a Linux Ubuntu implementation of the containerized web page Sock Shop (https://microservices-demo.github.io/) and its load testing.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Have both Docker and Docker Compose installed. Reference:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server)

**Implementation:**
1. Clone the application repository:

$ git clone [https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo)

2. Move to the directory microservices-demo:

$ cd microservices-demo

3. Start the application using Docker Compose:

$ docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d

Once the command exits the Sock Shop application should be up and running. Test it browsing to:

[http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

Once your testing ends, shut the application down:

$ docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml down

#### Load test

The load test packages a test script in a container for Locust that simulates user traffic to the Sock Shop webpage

It should be run against the front-end service. The address and port of the frontend will depend on the platform.

$ docker run --net=host weaveworksdemos/load-test -h $frontend-ip[:$port] -r 100 -c 2

The help command provides more details about the parameters.

$ docker run weaveworksdemos/load-test --help

For the $frontend-ip and $port above, use the docker inspect command and check the "NetworkSettings" section:

$ docker inspect $frontend_container_ID

If your machine gets overloaded you can change the '-r 100' parameter above, as this is just for experimenting purposes. At first my laptop got overwhelmed by the number of requests, then I changed '-r 100' to '-r 10' and it worked fine.
